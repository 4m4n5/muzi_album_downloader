# muzi_album_downloader
A python 2.7 script to download all tracks in a album from our local music streaming site - muzi by sdslabs.

You must have python 2.7 installed on your system and thats pretty much it.

Windows installation link - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8.msi

Just run the script and enter the album id of the desired album when prompted. The id is displayed in the url when you expand a particular album.

For instance on expanding 'Continued Silence- Imagine Dragons' the url changes to 'https://sdslabs.co.in/muzi/#/album/13651/continued-silence-ep-'
Hence the id is the number displayed in the url after '/album/' ie 13651

It will automatically download the specified number of songs from that album to your computer.

Cheers! :)
